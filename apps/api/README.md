# Social Feed API

Backend for the **Appifylab Full Stack Engineer selection task** — a social feed where users sign up, post text + image, like/unlike, comment with one level of replies, and toggle visibility between public and private.

Built with NestJS 11, Prisma 7, PostgreSQL 16, and Redis. The whole stack runs from a single `docker compose up` plus one migrate command. Designed against the brief's "millions of posts and reads" line: cursor pagination everywhere, composite indexes hit by every query, batched lookups so feed responses stay flat at any page size.

The task spec lives in `Assets/Selection Task for Full Stack Engineer at Appifylab/Selection Task for Full Stack Engineer at Appifylab.pdf` (sibling to this repo).

## Quick start

Prerequisites: **Docker Desktop running**, **Node.js 20+**, **pnpm 9+**.

Pick one of the two options below.

### Option A — One command (recommended)

```bash
pnpm bootstrap     # installs deps, creates .env, generates JWT secret,
                   # starts Postgres/Redis/pgAdmin, runs migrations,
                   # then boots the API on http://localhost:8000
```

That's it — when the NestJS logs print `Nest application successfully started`, open `http://localhost:8000` (or point the frontend at it). Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the API; the Docker containers keep running so a second `pnpm bootstrap` brings the app back up instantly.

The setup portion is idempotent — it never overwrites an existing `.env` or a JWT secret you've already set, so it's safe to re-run.

### Option B — Manual steps

If you'd rather run each step yourself (or you're debugging a setup issue):

```bash
# 1. Install deps
pnpm install

# 2. Copy env template (defaults work out of the box for local dev)
cp .env.example .env

# 3. (Optional) generate a real JWT secret and paste it into .env
openssl rand -hex 64

# 4. Bring up Postgres, Redis, pgAdmin
docker compose up -d

# 5. Run migrations (creates users, posts, comments, refresh_tokens, likes)
pnpm db:migrate

# 6. Start the API in watch mode
pnpm start:dev
```

The API will listen on `http://localhost:8000`. (Port 8000 leaves `:3000` free for the Next.js frontend so both apps can run side by side without a clash.)

Postgres is on `5434` (host) to avoid clashing with a default Postgres install. pgAdmin is on `http://localhost:5050` (login `admin@social-feed.local` / `admin`).

### Useful scripts

```bash
pnpm bootstrap         # one-shot local bootstrap (see Quick start)
pnpm db:up         # docker compose up -d
pnpm db:down       # docker compose down
pnpm db:migrate    # prisma migrate dev
pnpm db:reset      # prisma migrate reset (wipes everything)
pnpm db:studio     # prisma studio
pnpm build         # nest build
pnpm lint          # eslint --fix
```

## Environment variables

See `.env.example` for the full list with comments. The validator at boot (`src/config/environment.validation.ts`) refuses to start the app on a misconfig — for example:

- `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` must be at least 32 characters. Generate one with `openssl rand -hex 64`.
- `NODE_ENV=production` requires `COOKIE_SECURE=true` and a non-empty `CORS_ORIGIN` allow-list. Boots fail otherwise.
- Numeric env vars (ports, TTLs) have `@Min`/`@Max` bounds — `ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS=0` won't start the app.
- `DATABASE_URL` is validated as a real PostgreSQL URL.

This is the single highest-leverage safety check in the codebase. Misconfigured prod deploys die at boot, not at first request.

## What's built

Module-by-module breakdown of the API surface:

### Auth (`/auth/*`)
- `POST /auth/register` — creates a user and logs them in (returns access token + sets refresh cookie)
- `POST /auth/login` — credential check, constant-time bcrypt against a dummy hash to prevent email enumeration
- `POST /auth/refresh` — rotates the refresh token, detects reuse and revokes the whole family if a stolen token is replayed
- `POST /auth/logout` — revokes the current refresh-token family
- `POST /auth/logout-all` — revokes all the user's refresh-token families, blocklists their access tokens in Redis until their natural expiry

### Users (`/users/*`)
- `GET /users/me` — full self profile (includes email)
- `PATCH /users/me` — update firstName, lastName, avatarKey
- `DELETE /users/me` — soft-delete own account
- `GET /users/:id` — public profile of another user (no email leakage; returns `PublicUserDto`)

### Posts (`/posts/*`)
- `POST /posts` — create with `content` + optional `image` (multipart form). Sharp processes the image: auto-rotate via EXIF, strip EXIF/metadata, resize to 1080px max, convert to WebP, reject pixel bombs over 50M pixels.
- `GET /posts` — feed (newest first, cursor paginated). Returns public posts plus the viewer's own private posts.
- `GET /posts/:id` — single post; 404s for private posts the viewer doesn't own (no existence enumeration).
- `DELETE /posts/:id` — soft-delete own post; orphan image cleaned up.

### Comments (`/posts/:postId/comments`, `/comments/*`)
- `POST /posts/:postId/comments` — create top-level comment on a post
- `POST /comments/:commentId/replies` — reply to a top-level comment
- `GET /posts/:postId/comments` — paginated, newest-first
- `GET /comments/:commentId/replies` — paginated
- `DELETE /comments/:id` — soft-delete own (works for top-level and replies)

Comments and replies share a single table via self-referencing `parent_id`. The service enforces one level of nesting only — replies to replies return 400.

### Likes (`/likes/:type/:id`)
- `POST /likes/:type/:id` — like a post / comment / reply (idempotent)
- `DELETE /likes/:type/:id` — unlike (idempotent, no-op if not liked)
- `GET /likes/:type/:id/users` — paginated list of users who liked

Likes are polymorphic — one table covers all three target kinds. The type in the URL must match the target's actual shape (a reply liked via `/likes/comment/:id` is rejected, preventing double-likes via the unique-constraint loophole).

Each post and comment response includes `likeCount: number` and `hasLiked: boolean`. List endpoints batch these so the cost is two extra queries per page regardless of page size — no N+1.

## Architecture & decisions

### Auth pattern — JWT + opaque refresh tokens with family rotation
Access tokens are short-lived JWTs (15 min) signed with HS256 and a `jti` claim. Refresh tokens are 40 random bytes (not JWTs), stored as `sha256(token)` in the DB, sent only via httpOnly + `sameSite=strict` cookies scoped to `/auth`. Every refresh rotates the token and inherits the same `family_id`. A token marked `used = true` showing up again means the original was stolen and replayed — the whole family is revoked and the user is forced to re-authenticate.

Two-tier guards:
- `JwtAuthGuard` (light) — verifies JWT signature + expiry only. Used on reads.
- `JwtStrictAuthGuard` (strict) — adds a Redis blocklist check on `jti` and `userId`. Used on destructive operations.

Trade-off: light-guarded routes tolerate a ~15min staleness window after a mass-revocation event, in exchange for no Redis hit on the feed-scroll hot path.

### Response envelope
Every response, success or error, has the same outer shape:

```json
// Single resource
{ "success": true, "timestamp": "...", "data": { ... } }

// Paginated
{ "success": true, "timestamp": "...", "data": [...], "meta": { "hasMore": true, "nextCursor": "...", "limit": 20 } }

// Error (any 4xx / 5xx)
{ "success": false, "timestamp": "...", "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED", "message": "...", "details": [...] } }
```

Error codes are semantic strings (`CONFLICT`, `NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION_FAILED`, ...) — clients branch on the code rather than HTTP status numbers. Prisma codes (`P2002`, `P2025`, ...) are mapped at the filter layer; they never leak to the client.

### Image upload — local disk + sharp
Multer with `memoryStorage`, sharp pipeline (`.rotate().resize().webp()`), then `LocalStorageService.save()` writes to `./uploads/posts/<uuid>.webp`. Files are served by Express static middleware at `/uploads/*`.

`StorageService` is an abstract class — swapping to S3 / MinIO is a one-class change with no consumer-side modifications. For a hiring task that ships via docker-compose I chose local disk over MinIO so `docker compose up` works first try without bucket initialization rituals.

Static file serving deliberately doesn't auth-check image URLs. Post visibility hides the post body, but the image URL (random UUID) is treated as public-by-obscurity — same as Twitter / Instagram / Facebook. If stricter image privacy were required, the right move is signed URLs with TTL or a guarded `GET /posts/:id/image` streaming route.

### Polymorphic likes — no FK on the target
Likes can attach to posts, comments, or replies. Rather than three tables, one `likes` table with `target_type` + `target_id` covers all three. No DB-level FK on `target_id` (the type discriminator decides which parent table it points to) — existence is verified at the service layer before every write.

The unique index `(user_id, target_type, target_id)` is the trip-wire that makes likes idempotent. P2002 → return the existing row.

### Soft delete via Prisma client extension
Users, posts, and comments share a `status` column with a `DELETED` value. A Prisma extension (`src/prisma/prisma.extension.ts`) auto-injects `status: { not: 'DELETED' }` on every `findX` / `count` call. Services that delete just set the status — no rows are physically removed, and no consumer code needs to remember to filter.

### N+1 protection on feed reads
The classic trap: render 20 posts, then loop fetching like state per post = 40 queries. The likes service exposes two **batched** methods:
- `getLikeCountsForTargets(type, ids[])` — single `GROUP BY` query, returns `Map<id, count>`
- `getLikedTargetIdsForUser(userId, type, ids[])` — single `findMany`, returns `Set<id>`

Feed endpoints invoke both in parallel after the main `findMany`, so the total is **3 queries per feed page**, regardless of page size. The batched signatures make N+1 structurally impossible at the call site.

### Cursor pagination
Every list endpoint uses `cursor: { id: <last_id> }` + `take: limit + 1`. The `+1` tells us `hasMore` without a separate count. Stays fast at depth — offset pagination would scan-and-skip past growing chunks.

### Production-grade boot safety
The env validator (`validateEnvironment`) refuses to boot when:
- `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` is shorter than 32 characters
- `NODE_ENV=production` but `COOKIE_SECURE` isn't `true`
- `NODE_ENV=production` but `CORS_ORIGIN` isn't set
- Any port is outside 1–65535
- `DATABASE_URL` isn't a valid Postgres URL

A misconfigured production deploy dies at startup with a clear error — not at the first request.

## What's intentionally out of scope

The provided HTML design shows features the PDF brief explicitly defers ("you may ignore most of the design elements — focus only on the main functionality of the feed"). The following weren't built:

- Friend requests, find friends, suggested people, "connect" buttons
- Notifications panel
- Search bar
- Stories
- Save / hide / report / share post
- Edit post / edit comment (only create + delete)
- Email verification, forgot password
- Multi-level reply threading (one level enforced in service)
- Admin / moderator role tier (no roles in the spec)

The following are real production concerns but were deferred against the scope:

- Tests (the spec doesn't require them; broken scaffold tests would signal worse than no tests)
- Swagger / OpenAPI docs
- Request-ID correlation middleware (would slot into the error envelope's `meta`)
- Structured JSON logs (currently the Nest default Logger)
- Per-user throttle keys instead of per-IP
- Throttler Redis-backed storage for multi-instance scale (currently in-memory)
- S3 / CDN for image storage (local disk via the `StorageService` abstraction, swap path documented above)

Each of these has a clear next step in the codebase if/when needed — most are one-class or one-config changes thanks to the abstractions in place.

---

## Migration history

Six migrations, each one per feature branch:

```
init_users           — User + UserStatus (retroactively added during auth branch)
add_refresh_tokens   — RefreshToken + indices + FK to users
add_posts            — Post + visibility + status + author/visibility indices
add_comments         — Comment + self-FK + composite indices
add_likes            — Like + LikeTargetType + 3 indices including UNIQUE
```

Each migration matches the PR that introduced its schema change. Running `pnpm db:migrate` on a fresh DB replays all five in order.
